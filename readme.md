# Mass EduData Challenge: Exploring Data on Girls' Achievement in STEM Education

City Year believes in partnership and collaboration in all that we do, and that includes how we use research to shape our approach to solving the dropout crisis. Through the Mass EduData Challenge, we wanted to explore the participation and performance of girls in STEM education in different cities in MA. Check out our visualizations of AP exams, including Calculus, Computer Science, Biology, and Chemistry along with MCAS Science, Technology, and Engineering data.
